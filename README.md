## Inspiration
The goal of this project is to simplify the interview process and remove human biases by using an objective framework based on AI and Machine Learning. This project aims to help companies automate candidate selection for a job, allowing them to make informed decisions based on a more objective evaluation of the candidate's skills and experiences.

## What it does
This project is in its early stages, but the idea is to take a prerecorded interview video or audio and upload it to Assembly AI, which will return a text transcript. The transcript will then be analyzed using various NLP AIs, which will evaluate the candidate's skills and experiences, as well as their ranking compared to other candidates based on custom criteria provided by the company. Finally, the system will provide a qualitative and visual answer on the candidate's employability, helping companies make informed decisions about whether the candidate is a good fit for the company.

The process is represented in the chart below, which provides a better visualization of the process.

## Build Process
The creation of this project involved a combination of simple and complex technologies. To begin with, I used Assembly AI for transcription, followed by Streamlit, a Python tool, to develop the web application. Additionally, I leveraged the Parallel dots API for text analysis.

## Challenges
I ran into some challenges with the Assembly AI. However, the documentation helped me resolve the issue.

## Accomplishments
Having a working prototype to showcase for hackathon.  

## What I learned
Through working on this project, I have learned how to use Assembly AI and Streamlit to create web applications quickly. Furthermore, I have gained a deeper understanding of NLP and AI.

## What's next for Interview-Mate
- Adding more complex machine learning, NLP, and custom algorithms for better text analysis.
- Improving the user interface for professional use.
- Adding YouTube DL functionality so videos can be directly inputted from YouTube.
- And many more features to come.
